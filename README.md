# kuberport

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

> Template-driven self-service portal for Kubernetes.
> Admins publish YAML + ui-spec templates; non-experts deploy and operate via abstracted forms.

**Status:** early development — the [design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-initial-design.md) is approved and Plan 1 (vertical slice) is ready to execute. No runtime code has been merged yet.

## Why

Running Kubernetes well still requires reading a lot of YAML. Existing tools solve pieces of the problem:

- `k9s` / `Lens` / `Headlamp` are great for operators but assume you know k8s.
- `Rancher` / `OpenShift` template catalogs exist but lean on Helm and still expose resource-level concepts.
- `Backstage Software Templates` handle scaffolding but not day-to-day operation.

`kuberport` fills the intersection: one admin writes a template once; every teammate can deploy and watch it without ever seeing a `Pod`, `Deployment`, or `replicas` field they didn't ask for. Think "Swagger for Kubernetes" — a single spec becomes both the exact manifest that runs in the cluster and the friendly form an end user fills out.

## Core concepts

A **template** is two files (optionally three). Together they live as a single versioned row in the app database.

```
# resources.yaml  — pure Kubernetes YAML, no placeholders
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: { name: web }
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:1.25

# ui-spec.yaml  — which JSON paths to expose to end users
fields:
  - path: Deployment[web].spec.replicas
    label: "인스턴스 개수"
    type: integer
    min: 1
    max: 20
    default: 3
  - path: Deployment[web].spec.template.spec.containers[0].image
    label: "컨테이너 이미지"
    type: string
```

End users see a form with two fields (plus a release name). Everything else in `resources.yaml` is fixed by the admin.

A **release** is one deployment of a template version into a specific cluster + namespace. Releases are pinned to a template version (Helm/ArgoCD-style). When the admin publishes a new version, running releases keep working and get an "update available" nudge.

## Architecture at a glance

```
Browser ── Next.js (k8s Pod, BFF) ── Go API (in k8s) ── Target k8s clusters (N)
              │                         │
              ▼                         ▼
          Postgres                  (user OIDC token forwarded as-is;
       (sessions + meta)             k8s RBAC is the final authority)
```

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Monaco for YAML, React Hook Form + Zod for dynamic forms. Shipped as a k8s `Deployment` alongside the Go API in the same Helm chart — one `helm install` boots the whole stack.
- **Backend**: Go 1.22, Gin, `client-go`, `sqlc`, `atlas`, `coreos/go-oidc`.
- **Data**: PostgreSQL 16 in prod (SQLite for dev); OIDC + httpOnly cookie session, refresh tokens encrypted at rest.
- **Security model**: the app is a UX layer. Every k8s write is performed with the signed-in user's OIDC id_token, so Kubernetes RBAC decides what actually happens.

## Quick start (once Plan 1 lands)

```bash
# 1. Boot local Postgres + dex (OIDC)
docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 2. Apply DB schema
cd backend && atlas schema apply --env local --auto-approve

# 3. Run the Go API
go run ./cmd/server

# 4. Run the web app (another terminal)
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in OIDC + DB values
pnpm install && pnpm dev

# 5. Open http://localhost:3000 and log in as alice / alice
```

Until Plan 1 is executed these commands will fail — there is no `backend/` or `frontend/` code yet. Follow the roadmap below to see where things stand.

## Roadmap

Work is split into three plans that each ship usable software:

| # | Plan | Ships | Link |
|---|------|-------|------|
| 1 | **Vertical slice** | OIDC login, YAML-mode template CRUD, deploy form, release list & overview | [plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-mvp-1-vertical-slice.md) |
| 2 | **Admin UX** | UI-mode editor (tree + meta + live preview), publish/deprecate, version history | *(not written yet — follows after Plan 1 execution)* |
| 3 | **User observability** | Release logs (SSE), events, settings tabs, update-available migration, Helm chart for self-hosting | *(not written yet)* |

Deferred beyond the MVP: CRD support, Git-backed templates, team/RBAC UI, Helm chart import, release history.

## How to find context fast

- **I want to build something** → read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) then the current plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
- **I want to understand a decision** → [docs/brainstorming-summary.md](docs/brainstorming-summary.md).
- **I want the full system picture** → [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-initial-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-initial-design.md).
- **I want to run things locally** → "Quick start" above.

Not yet open to outside contributions — the shape of the system is still stabilizing. Once Plan 1 merges, issues and PRs will be welcome.
